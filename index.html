<h1>Web Careers: Here Are 13 Job Titles In The Web Industry</h1>
<h2>There are probably dozens of web careers that you can get. Even if you're not a programmer, there is still a place for you in web development.</h2> 
<p>You know what? The Internet is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a web, which means that it’s intersecting in the literal sense of the web. In a more technical sense, it means that it’s out there in the digital world. It’s also quite wide, even limitless, which means that it’s all-encompassing. It knows no borderline. It traverses all regions across the planet. So, when talking about web or Internet careers, there are plenty to consider nowadays.</p> 
<p>Talk about <a href="https://store.ramotion.com/blog/web-design-dying-career/">web careers</a> is important for all of us particularly to those who are seeking a well-paid job. Are you one of them? By the way, web-based careers or professions don’t just refer to the development part of a particular website. Their essence goes beyond that. Creating a website, for example, isn’t limited to the deeply technical aspects. Of course, it’s the website designer and developer to create a site. But there are other professionals who are often neglected as part of the entire web creation world.</p> 
<p>What now? You have to spend time reading this article completely. The purpose of this blog post is to enlighten your mind that there are a lot of careers to be found in the web industry. Not just are web designers and developers needed.</p> 
<p>Here are some of the most popular web careers:</p>
<h3>1.	Web developer</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the most basic. Okay, there is nothing basic about a website developer. We mean basic in the sense that it’s the first thing that people think about when talking about web careers. A web developer is the one to create a business website or any website that serves a particular purpose. This professional is equipped with technical know-how about CMS, web hosting, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Front-End and Back-End Elements, among other things.</p>
<p>Of course, web development is not complete without the other website components. But what does a web developer do exactly? This is actually quite a large task. Further to say, a web developer is responsible for creating the website and even web apps. They have to know the programming language in order to create a functional website.</p> 
<h3>2.	JavaScript developer</h3>
<p>In the above context, I mentioned JavaScript which is one of the web languages that a web designer and developer should be knowledgeable about. Clearly put, a web developer may be able to create a website. But how good is the website? Is it capable of doing complex matters? These are the questions which need to be answered clearly for you to be able to understand why JavaScript (abbreviated as JS) is vital.</p>
<p>A JavaScript developer is someone who adapts to the JavaScript programming language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="nofollow">JavaScript</a> is the part of the entire web development undertakings that make web design and development possible to realize. Performing complicated demands in a particular website project without processing time is the reason why this language is necessary. It runs on just-in-time compilation.</p> 
<h3>3.	UI designer</h3>
<p>Web development wouldn’t work without proper interface design. UI stands for user interface which dictates how a particular web application is going to look like and appear. The usability of the application is given an emphasis here.</p> 
<p>When it comes to websites, the design itself isn’t just about what looks good. It’s more complicated than that. It’s a matter of what looks pleasing technically. You have to understand that the process of creating a technically good design is user interface design or UI design. This is a matter of choosing the right color, a font to use, among other things. There is also proper spacing and the appropriate images to utilize by the website designer and developer. But it’s the UI designer who will guide the web designer with regards to all these aspects.</p> 
<h3>4.	UX designer</h3>
<p>The UI design will not be complete if you don’t have the user experience design or UX design. Take note that a UX designer is the one to take charge of the user-experience perspective. It’s about the experience of the users which reflects their satisfaction. Designing a UX model is a process which is important to be utilized by the designer as he or she designs a website. There are two aspects to be considered in the UX design: Functionality and Usability. Meaning, the site should be functional and easy to use.</p>
<p>Is a UX design really vital? Yes, because you don’t want a web visitor to be confused when navigating the site. If confusion happens, people might just leave the site and look for another similar company. The UX design also tackles responsiveness of the website.</p> 
<h3>5.	Graphic designer</h3>
<p>What is the main purpose of this design professional? A graphic designer is often mistaken as a web developer. The two job titles are not interchangeable, although they are somehow related. Got it? The graphic designer is actually more concerned about the visual effects of the web design project. Basically, this particular designer designs the images/photos, animations, and other graphic elements that the website needs. On the other hand, a web developer is the one who will develop and launch the site.</p> 
<p>Are the differences clear now?</p>
<h3>6.	Photographer</h3>
<p>People don’t always associate photographers with the process of creating websites. However, there is ample opportunity for photographers in this business. You see, one might have a well-developed site with beautiful UI and UX designs, but then the photos are just terrible. Isn’t that a turnoff?</p>
<p>That’s why a photographer is also necessary when creating a website. Imagine a product that is actually great for consumers but it just looked really ugly on the website. Would people actually buy it? That’s a great question!</p>
<h3>7.	Writer & editor</h3>
<p>Just like photographers, people might not necessarily think about writers as essential to the creation of the website. But people will actually have the same reaction if the copy of the site is badly written. Just like ugly photos, ugly copies will also be rejected by customers.</p> 
<p>You can say that the copy is ugly when it is marred with grammatical errors and confusing statements. It’s really essential to get a professional writer and even editor when creating a website.</p> 
<h3>8.	Marketing manager</h3>
<p>This job title is for people who are tasked at creating a marketing campaign. While the advertising sales representative sells digital spaces, the marketing manager is responsible for “selling” the entire company. The marketing manager should plan how to market the website to the public especially the intended market of the company.</p>
<h3>9.	Advertising sales representative</h3>
<p>Websites carry ads, too. People who have the gift of marketing could really make money selling advertising spaces on websites. This could be done on commission basis or the website owner could hire a full-time one. In some cases, one doesn’t even need a college diploma to be an advertising sales rep. The gift of gab is enough.</p> 
<h3>10.	SEO consultant</h3>
<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is necessary to provide web traffic. The goal is always to send traffic to the website. Not all of the people will buy or make a transaction through the website, but a fraction of them will. That means that the more people visiting the website, the higher the chances of making a sale. SEO can encourage traffic to the website. It’s a specialized skill, too, as there are parameters needed in creating the SEO keyword that will be used in blogs.</p>
<h3>11.	Branding consultant</h3>
<p>Here is another job title that is quite similar to the marketing manager. However, the branding consultant is more about the image of the company that owns the website. This is still a web career because the consultant will be able to share an advice or two in putting essential branding components on the website.</p>
<h3>12.	Blogger</h3>
<p>Now, this is different from a writer on the website, more popularly known as the copywriter. The copywriter writes content for the website while a blogger writes blogs. The blogs will then link to the website. In a way, while it’s not directly related to the creation of a website, it is responsible for sending user traffic to the site.</p> 
<h3>13.	Social media manager</h3>
<p>Just like the blogger, this is not directly linked to the actual creation of the website. Still, it’s a job that would send traffic to the website.</p>
<p>How? The person with this job title is responsible for managing the social media accounts of the company. The posts should be related to the company. The posts could also share the blogs written about the company. More importantly, the social media manager should post about the products and services of the company and share links to the website. </p>
<h3>Finding web careers: A Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are so many things you can do on the web. Whatever your expertise is, there is a space for you on the Internet. The above-mentioned opportunities are just some of the most popular jobs right now. With technology ever changing and always improving, expect more job positions to be created and opened soon. </p>
